# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to detect whether a given news article is **Fake** or **Not Fake** using various machine learning algorithms in Python. The model feeds on textual news information and classifies the news.

##  Project Overview

In the digital age, fake news is becoming a serious problem, as misinformation may spread very quickly via social media and the Internet. This project is designed on the supervised machine learning that models to identify fake and real news using the text content of the news.

We use the following models:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

##  Model Performance

All models were trained and tested using a labeled dataset of fake and real news. Below are the performance metrics on the test set (`xv_test`, `y_test`).
